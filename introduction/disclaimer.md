# ‚ùó Disclaimer

Currently all public executors on the market don't support every single function from the Universal Executor API! Be sure to check if your executor has the function you have seen on the list before it!

Some of the functions in the Universal Executor API don't exist in any executor on the market! This is my attempt at stimulating the growth of the standard for the executor environments. After all, I don't think that the manipulation of the Luau engine is that hard compared to defeating Hyperion.&#x20;

**I am by no means a professional!** I'm not even an old-gen. I started exploiting in between 2018 and 2020. I'm still learning! Trust me, 6 years of experience is nothing.

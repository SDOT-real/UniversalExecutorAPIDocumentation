# ‚ùó Disclaimer

Currently all public executors on the market don't support every single function from the Universal Executor API! Be sure to check if your executor has the function you have seen on the list before it!

Some of the functions in the Universal Executor API don't exist in any executor on the market! This is my attempt at stimulating the growth of the standard for the executor environments. After all, I don't think that the manipulation of the Luau engine is that hard compared to defeating Hyperion.&#x20;

I'm trying to completely revolutionize executor APIs. Old functions should still be present, but there should be new ones too. I saw other documentations that completely change how the environment is structured, but my goal is to stimulate developers to add new features, not to completely change the scene. That way the executor won't be completely useless to basic users and there will be no `local isexecutorclosure = ...` cases.

At the time of me writing this (12.02.2024), some limitations in the Universal Executor API are missing. Waiting for executor developers to consult me.

**I am by no means a professional!** I'm not even an old-gen. I started exploiting in between 2018 and 2020. I'm still learning! Trust me, 6 years of experience is nothing.

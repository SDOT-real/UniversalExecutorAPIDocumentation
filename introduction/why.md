# ‚ùì Why?

After <mark style="color:red;">Roblox</mark> purchased <mark style="color:green;">Byfron Technologies</mark> and introduced <mark style="color:purple;">Hyperion</mark>, the betrayal of <mark style="color:blue;">Synapse Softworks</mark> and the downfall of <mark style="color:red;">Roblox</mark> exploiting, ALL executors left the scene, some temporary, some permanently. This created a power vacuum, leading to the creation of new executors.

Sadly, some developers decided not to create their own documentation and instead rely on the documentations of their ancestors. Some documentations are _poorly_ written, some are incomplete. This is a disaster, in my opinion.

I, <mark style="color:red;">S.DOT</mark>, decided to create a beginner-friendly documentation with correctly typed functions, examples and listed limitations/warnings for functions/libraries. I'm also planning to add tutorials on various subjects and the history of exploiting.

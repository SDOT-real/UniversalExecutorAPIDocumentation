# ðŸ¥… Goals

### 1. Increase the quality of the available information

Sadly, some beginners still use outdated methods and are uninformed of some functions and their use cases. I want to fix that by providing examples and detailed descriptions for functions.



### 2. Raise awareness about forgotten ideas

Many new users don't know about old executors and their power. Some functions are simply forgotten. Meanwhile executor developers ignore pleas for new functions of old-gen scripters for various reasons. I want to raise a bit more awareness, instill love in people towards functions implemented in C. I don't think that if you can replicate the function in luau means that it will be more performant and undetected.



### 3. Increase the quality of community content

Due to obliviousness of new-gens about some methods in scripting their scripting journey may be harsh. Their scripts may be detected, poorly written and simply slow. To increase the quality of their lives I want to provide them better resources of learning.



### 4. Decrease gate keeping

Some old-gens love to gate keep new-gens by telling them to figure things by their own, avoiding detailed answers on their questions. I want to give an easy resource for new-gens to learn from, avoiding gatekeeping at least by reading my resources.



### 5. Cultivate better executor environments

I share the same views with the original UNC developers. All these "`local isexecutorclosure = ...` " incidents are just stupid. I want the community accept unified naming conventions. I understand that it requires a leading executor to have these functions to set a new standard (Synapse V3 incident), but I hope I'll at least make some contribution.
